After many years without a blog, I finally decided to bring back that old habit of
mine. I first started blogging almost a decade ago, in 2010. I was 15, and like
most of the [Gen Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z), I was born connected.
It was [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/)'s golden years. Eveyone I knew had a
blog back then. This was how we expressed ourselves in this new world called
Internet. My passion for computers began there, when I was choosing a blogger
theme and couldn't find one I truly like. After some searching around, I found
these _HTML and CSS things_ and that's how my journey began.

## Technology

I decided to use Hugo for it's simplicity, ease of deployment and _speed_. No
JavaScript bloat. Just pure, plain HTML and CSS (Sass, actually) &mdash;
just like the old days. I'm currently serving it in a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
instance running on Docker alongside some other internal services I need, but I
intend to move it to a S3 bucket after I'm done with these services.

## // to do:

I still need to fix some styling, acessibility and SEO issues, but for now
this is enougth. This blog's source is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/vtfr/victorfran.co/),
if you're curious.
